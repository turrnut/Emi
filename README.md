Emi is a High-Level, Just-In-Time(JIT) compiled, dynamically typed language with both its compiler and interpreter written in C. The compiler compiles to an intermediate representation (IR) before executing it.
The language is based on the Lox programming language by Robert Nystrom.

## Documentation
Coming soon... The syntax of the language will be put here.
